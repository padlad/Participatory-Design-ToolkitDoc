# Description of the elements of the tools

The different tools are used to support the participants' reflection
* The cards allow the collection of participants' proposals.
* The cards allow them to feed their reflections.

## Avatar card
The avatar is used to describe the main user of the TBA.

This form contains :
* Name
* His/her role
* His/her values and primary objectives: student participation, subject taught, results, order in the classroom, educational theory, etc.
*

## TBA Context Sheet
* What is its purpose?
* Level of analysis? (student, class, school, department, academy)
* Time horizon of analysis (during the session, for the next session, for the current session, for the next session ...) ?
* Point of interest (person, activity, context, result, content, social)
* Learning context (classroom, online, outdoor)
* What tools are observed?
* Data collection and analysis: real-time, or delayed
* Shared: indicate if the dashboard is shared, if so with whom
* Duration of observation: Specifies the duration of the situation observed, it can be a time in hours/minutes or day/month/year, sessions, modules



## Use Case Sheets
The use case sheets aim to inform the user's thoughts and actions regarding the dashboard.
Several cards are available. The participants change cards when they feel that they are at a different stage in their thinking. 3 types of steps are proposed:
* note a particular event;
* interpret the information;
* act to prepare the action.

For each card, participants note:
* the elements that trigger reflections,
* the data to be considered and their visualization,
* the manipulations they want to be able to perform on the data,
* the additional data to be presented according to the chosen modalities
* the hypotheses they want to explore and validate;
* possibly the following use case(s).

## Wireframe panel sheets
These sheets are intended to allow us to propose useful display panels for the understanding of each use case.

* A single wireframe sheet can be used to illustrate the different use cases. This display panel is the common entry point to the TBA.

* Each use case of the type "interpret" or "act" can be the subject of a dedicated panel sheet, or can be shown on another panel.

The use case sheets and the wireframe sheets are therefore associated.

## Decision cards
These are domain inspiration cards to help participants express the decision(s) they want to make through the proposed options.
The choices proposed are: adaptation, evaluation, evolution, planning, remediation, monitoring, which correspond to classic teacher practices. Each card has an explanatory text. Participants can propose other choices.

## Visualization and Data Maps
The visualization maps are inspiration maps, called technological maps, in the sense that they present the main existing visualization modes, to simplify the participants' choices.
To these maps, we associate data maps, which allow the participants to express the data to be visualized.
