* Indicator (**fr.** *Indicateur*) - on parlera plus spontanément de données

# Cognitive activities and states related to learning
* **Awareness** : One of the best-known definitions for awareness is provided by <sup>[Dourish and Belloti (1992)](#Dourish1992)</sup>: awareness is an understanding of the activities of others, which provides a context for your own activity. <sup>[Gutwin and Greenberg (1999)](#Gutwin1999)</sup> state that awareness:
   * Is knowledge about a state of the work environment in a limited portion of time and space.
   * Provides knowledge about changes in that environment.
   * Is maintained by all the interactions between the team-mates and the environment.
   * Is a part of an activity (completing a task, working on something). Maintaining awareness is not the purpose of an activity. Awareness is used to complete a task.

* **Situational awareness** is knowing what is happening in the environment and assessing its implications for the present and future. According to <sup>[Endsley 1995](#Endsley1995)</sup>: Situational awareness is the perception of the elements of an environment in a volume of time and space, the understanding of their meaning and the projection of their state into the near future*.

    * Perception
    * Comprehension
    * Projection
* Sensemaking** is the process of creating situational awareness and understanding to support decision making (Klein et al., 2007)
* Data Frames** - conceptual frame of reference - cognitive schema. According to Klein, the purpose of the frame is to 
1. define the elements of the situation 
2. describe the importance of these elements, 
3. describe the relationships between these elements
4. filter out irrelevant messages while highlighting relevant ones, and 
5. reflect the context of the situation, not just the data. 
* Data** - (in the context of *Sensemaking*) 
* Frame of Reference 
* **Cycle (activities) of Sensemaking** -
