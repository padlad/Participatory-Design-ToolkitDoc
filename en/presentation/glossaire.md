# Awareness, Sensemaking and decision-making
* Situational awareness is knowing what is happening in the environment and assessing its implications for the present and future (Endsley, 1995)
  * Situational awareness is the perception of the elements of an environment in a volume of time and space, the understanding of their meaning and the projection of their state into the near future*.

* Sensemaking** is the process of creating situational awareness and understanding to support decision making (Klein et al., 2007)
* Data Frames** - conceptual frame of reference - cognitive schema. According to Klein, the purpose of the frame is to 
1. define the elements of the situation 
2. describe the importance of these elements, 
3. describe the relationships between these elements
4. filter out irrelevant messages while highlighting relevant ones, and 
5. reflect the context of the situation, not just the data. 
* Data** - (in the context of *Sensemaking*) 
* Frame of Reference 
* **Cycle (activities) of Sensemaking** -
