# Presentation of the method

The objective of this method is to better understand and capture the needs of different users of Learning Dashboards (LAD).

## What is a Learning Dashboard?

A learning dashboard is thus a single display that aggregates different indicators about the learner, the learning process(es) and/or the learning context(s) into one or more visualizations [Schwendimann et al. 2017].

From a user-centric perspective, the main question is to define the uses of such dashboards. Why should I consult it? What information is useful to me and for what purpose? We then move from an arbitrary grouping of indicators to a support for the reflection (in the sensemaking) of users.



When we ask such questions to a user, it turns out that the answers are often evasive, for several reasons.
1. The manipulation, interpretation and use of digital data and indicators are part of the digital skills, but are not yet developed in the potential users.
2. Potential or proven uses in the educational domain remain limited. Known examples are either graphs of grades (spider diagram) or raw displays of information in LMS (last login, results). There is still a lot of work to be done in terms of exploration, collection, sharing, dissemination and display.
3. The integration in the educational processes remains to be done. A TBA must obviously be informative, but it must also make sense to users and thus improve their understanding of a chosen aspect (i.e. Sensemaking). This understanding should translate into an impact on learning, by eliciting an action from the users. If this understanding and these actions are new, they constitute desired learning, since they are equipped by a TBA that is intended to be consulted. They must therefore be accompanied and integrated into a pedagogical framework.
4. The terminology used can be embarrassing. It may not make sense in its context. A teacher or a student is *a priori* neither familiar with *Business Intelligence* nor with *cognitive science*.

## State of the art

### Naturalistic Decision Making and Sensemaking
situation Awareness
Sensemaking - frame
frame of Reference - frame of reference - conceptual frame of reference - cognitive schema - conceptual but also evolving, These are models, cognitive schemas internal to the person.

### Operationalization
The capture of needs is derived from classic methods in the field of HMI:
* the use of avatars allows the expression of contextual elements related to the person (his cognitive frame of reference) and his objectives
* the definition of use cases allows the capture of the different stages of the user's reasoning.
* The definition of wireframes for the different stages allows us to have a first draft of the targeted interfaces.

By grouping the reasoning steps, qualifying them as "data frame" and associating them with a display mockup (panel), it becomes possible to build a series of panels that support the operations of the reference frame.
The double interest is both to better qualify the reasoning and to facilitate the expression of transitions between panel displays.

Participatory design will support the expression of needs in a more open and creative way than interviews. It also allows for greater ownership of the outcome of the work.





## The Learning Dashboard Design Space

One of the difficulties of the field of *Learning Analytics* is that it deals with a variety of organizations, with many actors, and therefore potential users, which integrates many complex processes on which the levers of action are varied and often interdependent. Research in the educational sciences also shows that the impact obtained remains highly contextual. It is therefore essential to specify this context, and in the context of reuse, to assess the influence of the differences in context.

In order to allow the exchange with users, the capitalization and the design of TBA, it is necessary to define a shared framework allowing to express the needs through structuring notions for the discourse and the catalog of existing solutions on the one hand, and to propose a modeling framework on the other hand. [Shaw 2012] proposes the concept of design space as an explicative framework.  

### The user(s) of the TBA
Classically, in the field of *Learning Analytics*, users are differentiated between student/student, teacher, training manager, administration. Other types of users may appear, such as the person responsible for course lines on a platform.

The dashboard can be built to be used individually by a given user, but it can also be used by a group of peer users to coordinate, or by different users to mediate between 2 different roles (analysis of work done between teacher and students, sharing of courses by a course manager between teachers, ... )

### Objective of the TBA: a decision

The consultation of a dashboard is first of all informative, and allows to explain information on the state of a process through indicators. It is therefore an entry point for monitoring the progress of the process. As long as the indicators remain within values considered normal, it is a simple monitoring. But in fact, designing a TBA comes down to asking the question of:
1. What are these normal values to integrate them in the display?
2. What are the possible, productive reactions to apply if the user simply wants to improve these indicators or if these values deviate from normal? In other words, what decisions does the user make?
3. What understanding does the TBA support to support decision making?
4. Once the goal is defined, additional action steps may be needed. The dashboard can help build the information needed for effective action.

To express these different elements, we use the model proposed by [Lycett and Marshan 2016] which integrates 3 states similar to those proposed by [Endsley 1995] in terms of *Situation Awareness* and the manipulation of a frame of reference through concept manipulations similar to that proposed by [Klein et al. 2006].

The figure below represents the *Conceptual Sensemaking Model* introduced in [Lycett and Marshan 2016]

This model allows us to clarify different elements that can contribute to the design and classification of a TBA:
1. The elements that trigger the decision-making process: what are the problematic stimuli likely to trigger the decision-making process. The idea here is to display a table with indicators related to these stimuli.
2. The interpretation steps that the user will go through to build an understanding of the phenomenon, to link data and hypotheses
3. The user's frame of reference, or cognitive schema, is constructed by interpreting data, validating/invalidating hypotheses, and assembling them with clues. These elements appear on the one hand through the stages of interpretation, but can also remain implicit, corresponding to the user's experience, thought patterns and values.   

### Its context
Various elements allow us to specify the framework for using the dashboard. These elements allow the participants in the design process to clarify the question they are asking themselves:
* Level of analysis
* Point of interest
* Horizon
* Learning context
* Data
* Data Collection
* Observed tools
These elements may appear beforehand, or in the exploration of the use cases. They are not essential for the explanation of the TBA.


## Tips for a more efficient use of the table

### Simplify the visualization
resume visual analytics canons
### Present the information in a way that engages the user
See [Jivet et al. 2020]
### Create a context that is conducive to the use of information
- interventions
- ability to act - ownership
* See [Wise 2014]
## Capturing needs - a participatory approach


Define an avatar:
* Qualify the user
* His frame of reference
   * His primary goals
   * His reasoning modes
   * ...
* The purpose of the TBA
  * What information is being followed? For what purpose?        
* The use cases: when faced with a problem situation, how does he react? How does it build its reasoning? according to what steps? with what hypotheses?
* Wireframes: what are the data that allow reasoning or appropriation, how to present them?



## Next: create the TBA, use it, and measure its relevance
